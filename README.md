Welcome to my codewars repository!

All solutions you find here are, of course, completely hand coded.
In many files you see more than one solution. Thatâ€™s because the first solution is the one I submitted, and after the look on solutions from others I took good solutions as templates to implement better solutions than my first one.
In general, I take codewars as a platform to learn from each other. Thanks to all who submitted their solutions! And feel free to learn from the solutions you find here!

Happy coding!
Gregor
